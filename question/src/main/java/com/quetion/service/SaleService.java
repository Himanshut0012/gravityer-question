     1. first rule ->
     Discount maximization for Customers. The customerâ€™s objective is to create a pair of
      2 items so that the discount is maximized.

      2. second rule ->
      Customers can buy one product and get another product for free as long as the
price of the product is less than the price of the corresponding product in pairs.


3 rule is ->
Customers can buy two products and get two products for free as long as the
price of the product is less than the price of the first product.
